## Example Instances

- Example: <https://helpful-info.github.io/example>  
  An instance with all features available and used, with non-realistic example content.

- Example - Multilingual: <https://helpful-info.github.io/example-multilingual>  
  An instance with the self-translated "multi-language"-mode enabled. So it has "a sheet per language" in wich the content and hierarchy should be aligned.
  It also uses local data, so not using the Google Sheets API.

Both instances collect usage-metrics using a self-hosted [Matomo](https://matomo.org/)-instance.
